Navigation Enhancer v2.0 by joey.neuralyte.org

aka Retrace Your Steps

When moving the cursor between windows, given a choice of target windows,
Vim normally uses the *cursor position* to choose the destination window.

However I think a more intuitive approach when there may be more than one
potential target window is to pick the one which was *used most recently*.

Or perhaps more accurately, we want the window that we *last entered from, in
that direction*.

So now if I casually move between windows in one direction, and then in the
opposite direction, I should always return to the window I started from!
