" When moving the cursor between windows, given a choice of target windows,
" Vim normally uses the *cursor position* to choose the destination window.
"
" However I think a more intuitive approach when there may be more than one
" potential target window is to pick the one which was *used most recently*.
"
" Or perhaps more accurately, we want the window that we *last entered from, in
" that direction*.
"
" So now if I casually move between windows in one direction, and then in the
" opposite direction, I should always return to the window I started from!

" BUG: When you split a window, it may cause the numbers of other windows to
" change!

"" Override Vim's default keymaps for window navigation:

noremap  <silent> <C-W>j         :call <SID>SeekBestWindow("j","k")<Enter>
noremap  <silent> <C-W>h         :call <SID>SeekBestWindow("h","l")<Enter>
noremap  <silent> <C-W>l         :call <SID>SeekBestWindow("l","h")<Enter>
"" I also like them to work in Insert mode!
